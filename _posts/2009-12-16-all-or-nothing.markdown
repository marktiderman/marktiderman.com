I have this little personality trait, its called all or nothing. Somedays its a gift but today its a curse. I can't do things on a small scale.

For instance; I started this blog months ago, but this is my first real post. Why? Because I've been waiting until I can post my entire heart and document everything. So **since I don't have time to do it "ALL" I subconsciously decide to do "NOTHING"**. Kind of lame I know, but that is the world I live in. Until now, my goal is to change that.

Take poverty for instance. I think the reason most of us do nothing is because we are so overwhelmed by the huge need in the world. Here is a typical chain of events that takes place in my mind every couple days.




  1. I see a need
  2. I get excited and I start thinking how I help
  3. **I'm not content with helping just one, I try to help everyone**
  4. Reality sets in and I realize I can't help everyone
  5. I get discouraged
  6. I do nothing, Nothing changes


So after years of being disabled by this discouraging cycle, I've decided to do a little soul searching. If my intentions are to make a difference, but I usually end up doing nothing, where does my plan break down? _(pause for dramatic effect) _I'm learning that the problem is in my "all or nothing" mentality. Its when I lose site of "the one" that I get overwhelmed and end up doing nothing. What if I decided to not look at the masses but only focus in on "the one" whom God has placed in front of me. Lets try this again.




  1. I see a need
  2. I get excited and I start thinking how I help
  3. **I focus on the one and the need at hand**
  4. I meet the need, I help the one, God's love is passed on
  5. The one is encouraged, I am encouraged,Â God is glorified
  6. Our world changes for the better


So my challenge is to break my own cycle. **I must focus on the one and the need at hand. ** I encourage you do do the same. This falls in line with the age old proverb:


<blockquote>"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time."</blockquote>


__In the next couple days I'll be sharing a practical plan to put this into place on your own world.
