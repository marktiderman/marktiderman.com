  * Intro: From Stranger to Intimate Friend (5 min)

	
    * Mexico

	
      * 12 years ago my life was changed forever. I was 19 years old. Sitting at the baggage claim Minding my own business in the Mexico City airport. on March 22nd 2002. That is the day that the prettiest girl in the universe walked into my life. Michelle Oppito. 

	
      * #slide Michelle&MarkiePic

	
      * That week, we found ourselves as a part of a larger team serving alongside one another in the garbage dumps of Mexico City. Serving the poorest of the poor. A ragtag group of 32 team members from Cincinnati Oh and Pittsburgh PA. We spent time together, we depended on one another

	
      * That week changed my life. We started a relationship.

	
      * Before that week, Michelle Oppito was a stranger. someone I'd never met before, never spent time with, never spoken to, never depended on.

    * Get time alone with Him

	
      * #verse Mark 1:35

	
        * if anyone was in high demand it was Jesus

	
        * Because of the priority of the relationship he found ways to escape

      * If he is our helper, are we in a place that we need help

	
      * Him leading us. being our guide. Going to the hard places.

	
      * Wanting More #verse Luke 11:13

	
        * We should continually ask for “more of the Holy Spirit” (Luke 11:13; Matt 7:7-11)

	
        * Pray to be filled with the Spirit. Ask for His power to be released in our lives. The Holy Spirit can enable us to do something or equip us to bring forth the Kingdom.

  * Closure - When A Gift Becomes A Burden (5 min)

	
    * #story Early morning wakeup in Pitt

    * #verse Acts 2:38

	
      * And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit

	
      * I don't think its any coincidence that peter refers to the holy spirit as a gift. 

	
      * A question for all of us. 

	
        * If we're really honest with ourselves. Do we see our relationship with God as a burden or a gift. 

	
        * If someone watched us with how we interacted. Would they call us strangers, acquaintances? 

	
        * Or would we be known as a people who Talks with the living God, Is known by the living God, Depends on the living God.











**Scripture References:**



	
  * **1 Corinthians 3:16**

	
  * **Galatians 4:6-9  --  **And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more

	
  * **Romans 8:14-17  --  **For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him

	
  * **Phil 1:29  --  **For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake

	
  * **Mark 1:35  --  **And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed

	
  * **John 14:25-27  --  **“These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.

	
  * **John 14:15-17  --  **“If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you

	
  * **Luke 12 11-12  --**  And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say, for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say

	
  * **Luke 11:13**

	
  * **Acts 2:38**
