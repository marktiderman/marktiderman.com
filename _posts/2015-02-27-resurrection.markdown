My friend Jonny is burying his dad today.

Most people don't understand it, but there is something very special about a day like today. I find myself longing again for the day I buried my dad. Partly because of the closeness I felt that day with my friends and family.But also because of the life and purpose found when great sadness meets great joy. It causes us to grieve with anticipation as we peer into the edge of eternity. Longing for what seems impossible yet in Christ, we know is inevitable.

Resurrection.
