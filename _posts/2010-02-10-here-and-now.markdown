I'm a dreamer.Â Â Always looking to the future.Â  One problem I've found with always looking ahead is the inability to live in the present.

Here is an example.
We are just getting into the thick of real winter here in Cincinnati.Â  In fact, we just got our second real snow storm of the year and I expect another 2+ months of bitter cold.Â  It's been a lot of fun playing in the snow with my 2 year old.Â  He can outlast anyone in the cold so I've had to toughen up in order to keep up.Â  I've seriously had to bribe him with hot chocolate and cookies just to get him in the door before frostbite sets in.

His snow gear isn't very goodÂ so this past weekend I went on a mission to find some new snow pants forÂ my little man.Â  My first stop was aÂ local all-purposeÂ store.Â  I was shockedÂ at how limited their selection was.Â Â I found only a fewÂ garments on clearance, so I figured IÂ was in the wrong department.Â  I decided to ask a store clerk for help.Â  Below is a transcript of the conversation.Â  Keep in mind it was January 8th.


<blockquote>ME: "Can you please help me find a pair ofÂ size 3T snow pants?"
CLERK: (sounding surprised that I even asked) "Snow pants? I'd check the clearance rack.Â Â But I doubt you'll find anything.Â  We're done with winter.Â "
ME: (afterÂ an awkward pause) "Really?Â  It's snowing outside right now."
CLERK: "Well, we're ontoÂ summer now."
ME: "Um...ok, I guess I'll go someplace else.Â  Thanks."</blockquote>


This store was so concerned with makingÂ a sale 5 months from now that they couldn't make one today.Â  I wonder how often that happens to me.Â  I'm challenged as I look at my job, my ministry, my life.Â  How often do I...



	
  * dream about my next phase of life, but act inept in my current one.

	
  * travel half way around the globe to love a stranger, but overlook my neighbor.

	
  * wish for newÂ possessions, but fail to enjoy the gifts I've already been given.

	
  * focus so much onÂ loving others, yet overlook the love and attention my family needs.


_Father, help us toÂ stay attentive to the here and now.Â  To experience your love and pass that on to others.Â  Amen._
