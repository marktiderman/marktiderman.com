Tonight marks the eve of a very big journey. Tomorrow morning the 5 of us will be packing the car full of clothing, toys, pack'n'plays, bathing suits, backpacks, and 100 other misc things as we start our journey to Pittsburgh. We are moving there for the next few months to spend some very important time with my parents, my sister, and her family. We are also shutting down our family business (or at least my involvement within it) for the next few months. 

You see, a few weeks ago we received the news that my father had been diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer. It hit me like a ton of bricks (I plan to elaborate in an upcoming post). Then I received the challenge to honor my father and mother. So we're going. 

My wonderful sister and her beautiful family have invited us to stay with them so we will be invading their home for the next few months. I'm looking forward to catching up on lost time because we haven't lived in theÂ same city since high school. 

I do not know what the next few months will bring, but I do know that God is good and He is up to something. Anytime God has asked us to trust him in the past and we have followed him, he has always done something powerful in our lives. So I'm really anticipating that God is going to do something miraculous. Maybe the healing of a body. Maybe the healing of a heart. Or maybe even a healing of a family. 

Come Lord Jesus. We are following you and we trust you.
