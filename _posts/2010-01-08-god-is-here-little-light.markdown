Tonight we took part in a prayer vigil for a 5 year old girl in Phoenix. Her name is [Kate McRae](http://prayforkate.com/#/home-page/). She was diagnosed with a brain tumor about 6 months ago. Today was the long awaited MRI and on it hung all their hopes of recovery. The report came back positive leaving their family in brokenness.

Tragedy and hardship seem to either lead people into forsaking God or into a greater dependence on Him. Kate's battle with cancer has proven their faith to be pure gold; they have been an inspiration to thousands.

We are believing Jesus for a miracle. I know Jesus can heal, for he has done so in the past.Â  Ive also prayed for things in the past that did not take place.

I'm learning to trust in his timing, in his "Greater Story", on him having our back. Thank you for Kate's life and testimony.

Please heal her body in such a way that there wont even be the smell of cancer on her.
