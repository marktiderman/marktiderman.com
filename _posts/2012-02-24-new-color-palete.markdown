We used to consider ourselves a "blue" family. The color blue and its brothers black and gray have successfully graced our world for the past 4.5 years. Along with trucks, swords, footballs, and hockey sticks.

That all changed about 8 days ago. Little Selah Joy entered our world and the enchantment of pink and her sister purple has just begun.

It is crazy to think how these colors truly do effect the lens in which we view the world. I can't wait to see how my view changes for the better.
