"Why am I so far behind?"

I often find myself uttering those words under my breath. They never come from an encouraging spirit but rather a condemning one. Whether it's second guessing a business decision, organizing my office, or sticking withÂ a daily reading habit,Â I often feel like I'm way behind. Like I've chosen the wrong path and now I have to track back and catch up.

I wonder though is it because I'm way behind or could it be that I'm right where I'm supposed to be. OrÂ at leastÂ I'm right where I am. Deep? Not really. More like so close to the surface I've been missing it all along.

There is the nagging that tells you "Hurry up! You really need to be going somewhere." Maybe its true, maybe we do need to be going somewhere, but I doubt that we should beÂ sacrificingÂ the here and now for hopes of tomorrow. Its like chasing the gold at the end of the rainbow. The leprechaun's chase is enticing but always leaves us empty handed. Cause when we're living for tomorrow I guess it always stays just one day away.
