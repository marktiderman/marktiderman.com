Day 2 of our journey concludes. Today was filled with prayers, tears, memories, heartache, and joy.

This song sums up our hearts as we lean in to God more. Trusting in his goodness and that He will lead us through.

It has been echoing in our home, cars and hearts the past month.

My favorite line is â€œHere's my heart Lord, speak what is true.
