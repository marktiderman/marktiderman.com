When faced with suffering my tendency is to despair. The darkness of that moment whispers a simple lie to me. "You are alone". I'm convinced that the pain of feeling abandoned is much worse than any adversity that I have encountered. In the right mindset,Â I can handle any form of physical pain or suffering. But as soon as that gets translated to abandonment, game over. Its my kryptonite.

I must learn how to filter these thoughts through the truth. When I hear "You are alone", I must respond with "No I am not. Nothing can separate me from the Love of God. For my Father has promised to never leave me nor forsake me".

Lead me Jesus.
