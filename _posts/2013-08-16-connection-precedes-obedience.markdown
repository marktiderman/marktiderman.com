"Why don't my kids listen to me? Why won't they do what I say? How come they don't obey me?"

I have asked those questions a million times over the past few years. And if I dig a little deeper, it's usually preceded with some form of "Wow, it's been a while since I've spent good time with my kids."

Today I got a glimpse of the correlation between connection and obedience.

**Connection is the fuel for true obedience.**

I tend to focus directly on obedience, but I'm learning to take a more indirect approach. I find that when I focus directly on changing behavior I rarely get the result I want. Life has taught me lots of great ways to get people (including myself) to do things I want them to do. I've learned to intimidate,Â shame,Â manipulate, and bribe. But the truth is that these techniques come with a price. I may get my kids to do what I say, but I also get the side effects of fear, embarrassment, distrust, or corruption.

I wonder what would happen if I ...
  * spoke less and listened more?
  * focused less on my kid's obeying me and more on building trust through connecting with them?
  * spent less energy condemning myself for my lack of obedience to God and more time connecting with Him?
We're about to find out...
