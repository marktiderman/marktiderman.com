These are my driving assumptions for why I believe it is vital for us to "create space for God to show up" in our lives.



I believe that:






  * God is actively involved in our lives


  * God thrives in our weakness


  * If you are making an example of how great something is, you don't use subjects that are already strong or already hold the benefits of what you are trying to portray. You choose the weak.


  * God is a gentlemen, and will not force himself on those who do not give him room to work


  * Those who are looking for him will see him
