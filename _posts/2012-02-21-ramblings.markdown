We have been through quite a bit in the past 5 years. We moved back to the US, started a company, planted a church, and had 3 kids. Actually just a few days ago we welcomed our third child into the world.  Her name is Selah Joy. She is our first daughter and she has already stolen my heart.

Needless to say I am a little sleep deprived right now and my schedule leaves me with even less discretionary time.  So I thought what better time to get back into blogging. I have a lot of thoughts running through my head...always. I tend to get lost when I try to navigate them. So I'm taking up a new discipline.  Writing something every day. I hope to use this platform as a chance to process. The good news is that nobody reads this so I should be under the radar.

Lets hope I can increase my post per year ratio.
