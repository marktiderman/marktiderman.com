![Restoration Hardware - Farmhouse Table](/assets/prod1606015_R12.jpg)

It's a farmhouse table for our dining room. The inspiration came fromÂ [Restoration Hardware](http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod1606015&categoryId=cat1661028)and the plans I am using were created byÂ [Ana White](http://ana-white.com/2009/12/plans-farmhouse-table-knock-off-of.html).

This past year a few of my good friends started building their own dinner tables. I'veÂ caught the bug, and now I'm building one myself. I'm learning a ton in the process. I've built a number of projects over the years but nothing that comes close to this type of precision.

I am praying over it as I work. My prayer is that God will use our home and our family to invite those around us into His story. May truth, love, great food, and many menories be shared at this table for generations to come. Amen.
