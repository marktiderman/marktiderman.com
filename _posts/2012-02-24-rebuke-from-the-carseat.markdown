I was driving in the car today when a question arrived from the carseat in the back.

**Marcos**: "Daddy, are you driving?"
**Me**: "Yeah buddy I'm driving."
**Marcos**: "OK good. Cause I saw you looking at your phone and i was wondering who was driving this thing?"
_(awkward silence as I pull the car over to reflect on the rebuke my 4 year old just gave)
_**Me**: "Wow, Your right buddy. Thanks for reminding me. I was making a bad choice. Please forgive me for being careless."

I had plenty of excuses to give. I was late; I needed to check for directions; I was expecting an important email, etc; But this was not the time for excuses.

This has been on my mind the rest of the day. I'm now wonderingÂ how many other times I choose convenience and comfort and put at risk what I value most.
