Prayer 101
    **Intro**:
        1. This is an introduction to prayer
        2. We cannot cover everything in this one night
        3. We are not experts, just have a passion to see a culture of prayer at Red Door
        4. This may be a little bit like drinking from a fire hose.  There is so much to cover so please follow up with us afterwards or in the coming weeks if you want to clarify
        5. We will pause for questions throughout
        6. Introductions and Why You Are Here
    Theory - Foundations of Prayer (5:30-6:30)
    **How to Pray**
        **Just pray**
            We learn to pray by praying.  
            "Though a man should have all knowledge about prayer, and though he understand all mysteries about prayer, unless he prays he will never learn to pray."  Samuel Chadwick
        **The Lord's Prayer**
            The Disciples never asked Jesus how to preach a sermon or how to perform miracles but they asked how to pray
            The Lord's Prayer wasn't meant to be something just repeated, but a model of where our hearts should be in prayer.  
            So while we are not going to walk through every line of the Lord's prayer, these guidelines are all reflective of principles of it.
            We will also talk more about that in the model of prayer for Closet Prayer
        **Re-order our loves **
            As Christians we are commanded to love many things. Love one another, love your neighbor, love your spouse, love your children, but ultimately we are commended to love God first.  
            If God is not our first love, we will use prayer selfishly to get the things we desire more than him.
                Luke 14:26 "If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters--yes, even their own life--such a person cannot be my disciple."
                Our "other loves" must comparatively resemble hatred compared to our love for God.  
                Anything that we love more than God is an idol.  (thou shall have no other God's before me)
                Our hearts are an idol making factory and therefore we will constantly find ourselves with "loves" that outrank our love of God. 
                The primary purpose of prayer is to reorder these loves and place them in proper priority
            If God is not the starting point, our emotional needs will drive our prayer and be the focus of our prayer. 
            Loving God first causes us to pray in line with God's will
            Examples
                Finances
                Health
                Comfort 
                Family
                Happiness over holiness
                Success
                Approval
        **Pray the Word **
            **Gives us our vocabulary**
                Getting our vocabulary from the Bible. Like a child who is immersed in vocabulary and speaks it back.
            **Roots our prayers in reality**
                "We should not decide how to pray based on the experiences and feelings we want.  Instead, we should do everything possible to behold our God as he is, and prayer will follow.  The more clearly we grasp who God is, the more our prayer is shaped and determined accordingly.  Without immersion in God's words, our prayers may not be merely limited and shallow but also untethered from reality.  We may be responding not to the real God but to what we wish God and life to be like.  Indeed, if left to themselves our hearts will tend to create a God who doesn't exist."  Tim Keller, Prayer, p.62
            **Gives us promises to pray back to God**
                "One thing is certain: our most powerful prayers are hyperlinked to the promises of God. When you know you are praying the promises of God, you can pray with holy confidence. It’s the difference between praying on thin ice and praying on solid ground. It’s the difference between praying tentatively and praying tenaciously" Mark Batterson
            **Examples**
                God will never leave you or forsake you (Deuteronomy 31:8)
                God is our refuge and our strength, a very present help in times of trouble (Psalm 46)
                God is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit (Psalm 34:18)
                He hems us in behind and before (Psalm 139)
                If God is for us, who can be against us (Romans 8)
                God's mercies are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22-23)
            **Choose a verse and start there every time!**
        **Praying with Authority**
            **In Jesus' Name**
                **the name of the king**
                    The kings seal
                **Coming to God not on our own merit but that of the Son**
                    "Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it."  John 14:13
                    Trusting in Christ for acceptance
                    Re-grounding our relationship with God on the saving work of Jesus over and over again.  
            **As Sons and Daughters**
                "Prayer is the privilege of sons and the test of sonship."  Samuel Chadwick
                Slaves - don't pray out of pride or pray legalistically
                Orphans - beg or run away
                Sons  - pray confidently knowing their Father and identity in Him.
                Using the word Papa
                Recognizing your status as God's child regardless of your inner state.  
        **Pray Boldly &amp; in Submission **
            **Intro**
                Hebrews 5:7 "During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission."
            **Boldness**
                Importunity - being demanding and insistent
                We are invited to specifically, intensely and repeatedly make our needs known in prayer with confidence they will be heard.
                    James 1:6
                    1 John 5:14
                    Luke 11:9-10
                    Ephesians 6:18
                We are promised that God hears us
            **Submission**
                Our Father is infinitely wise. He knows what is best and always wants what is best for His children
                Bring our hearts to trust in His wisdom, not ours
                End with "nevertheless, thy will be done."
                Laments throughout the Psalms always end with a declaration of truth and trust
                God will give you what you would have asked for if you knew everything He knows
                Patience in His timing
                    2 Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness
                    Perseverance!
            **Freedom and incentive to pray!**
                God will not give us anything contrary to His will.
                Don't be afraid you will ask for the wrong thing.  Of course you will!
                The Holy Spirit takes our core prayers and prays as we should be praying before the throne (Romans 8:26)
                God tempers the outcome with his incomprehensible widsom
            **Conclusion**
                "If we over-stress submission, we become too passive.  We will never pray with the remarkable force and arguments that we see in Abraham pressing God to save Sodom and Gomorrah or Moses pleading with God for mercy for Israel, or Habakkuk and Job questioning God's actions in history.  However, if we over-stress "importunity," if we engage in petitionary prayer without a foundation of settled acceptance of God's wisdom and sovereignty, we will become too angry when our prayers are not answered.  In either case, we will stop praying patient, long-suffering, persistent yet nonhysterical prayers for our needs and concerns."
        **Fervent and Prevailing Prayer**
            **Pray Fervently**
                Antonyms of fervent are detached, dry and impersonal. 
                "Prayers are measured neither by time nor by number, but by intensity."
                Saying Prayers vs. Praying (Chadwick)
                    Power, confidence, heart, intensity, etc.
                    If you have a need, do you want someone praying weakly over you or with boldness and confidence?
                Not just saying words but coming before the throne of God in grace
                Believe what you are praying (faith!)
                Be intentional with your words
                Perseverance
                    True prayer grows more fervent when God delays to answer
            **Prevailing Prayer**
                Charles Spurgeon says that there are common experiences to all Christians, such as joy and hope.  And then there is an increased level of communion with Christ which is high above that which the common believer experiences. 
                The key to unlocking a deeper experience of God is prevailing prayer.  Synonyms for prevailing are regular, common, steady, and established.  Antonyms are limited, unimportant, uncommon.  So our regular pursuit of God in prayer brings us to new levels with God.  
        **The Question of Unanswered Prayer**
            God promises that He hears our prayers
                Jeremiah 33:3
                Psalm 5:3 - In the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation
                Psalm 6:9 - The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer
                Psalm 9:10  - For you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you.
                Psalm 65:2 - O You who hear prayer, to you all men come.
                Psalm 66:19-20 - But certainly God has heard; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.  Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer nor his lovingkindness from me.Psalm 5:3 - In the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation
            But not all sincere, earnest, believing prayers are granted
                Moses - going to Canaan
                Elijah - that he might die
                Paul - for the removal of affliction
            "We know God will answer us when we call because one terrible day he did __not__ answer Jesus when __he__ called."
            No is as much of an answer as Yes.
                Refusal may be the only answer possible to love, wisdom and truth
                God never refuses without a reason
                "A child may cry for a razor and full grown people may cry for things equally unsuitable, unsafe, and unwise.  Many have lived to thank God that He withstood their agonizing entreaties at some particular time or for some particular thing that seemed indispensable.
                Delays are not denials
                No is never God's last word
                    "In Glory shall we find our prayers have been interpreted according to the infinite wisdom and eternal love of God our Father who bids us pray."  Chadwick

        Questions
            If God's will is always right, and submission to it is so important, why pray for anything with fervor and confidence? 
                God invites us to do so and promises to answer prayers because he is good and our loving heavenly Father
                God often waits to give a blessing until you have prayed for it.  Why?  Good things that we do not ask for will usually be interpreted by our hearts as the fruit of our own wisdom and diligence. Gifts from God that are not acknowledged as such are deadly to the soul, because they thicken the illusion of self-sufficiency that leads to overconfidence and sets us up for failure.
                "God will not give us anything contrary to his will and that will always include what is best for us in the long run.  We can, therefore, pray confidently because he won't give us everything we want.  
                "Don't be afraid that you will ask for the wrong thing.  Of course you will!  God 'tempers the outcome' with his incomprehensible wisdom." 103
                Where you do not get an answer, or where the answer is not what you want, use prayer to enable you to rest in his will.
